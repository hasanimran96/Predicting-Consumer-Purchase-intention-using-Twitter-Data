undefined,Must be pretty  bad  if an  iPhone   X  S is actually an improvement. The battery life on the  X  (along with flaky FaceID) drove me to get that 8 Plus when the red one came out.
undefined,I  hate  how people call the  iPhone  XR “10 R” instead of “ X  R”.
no,should a 12 yr old get an iwatch for christmas w/ and  iphone   x ?  she would be turning 13 the next month. does that make me a  bad  mom if i say yes or no?? i need help.
undefined,What is the most  expensive  thing you've ever bought? — Honestly
no,Yea I used to have the  X  and had a crazy amount of problems. I have the Max now and it scans perfect almost everytime if you have Sprint and you had the  X  for a year I think you can trade it in for the max with  iPhone  forever and it’ll only be like $4 more  expensive  on your bill
undefined,uGH i dropped my  iphone   x  in water and im so....... djdjdj pls i  hate  myself
undefined,I was really hoping your post about your  iPhone  XS being in a bootloop was just an April fools joke. Guess not. That sucks hella  bad  dude. Sorry man. My buddies  IPhone   X  bootlooped yesterday too. Except his was random. No jailbreak at all.

no,Two kids come in wearing gucci clothes and then Tim's on with chains and some watch but these kids had to share a air pod bc that shit is too  expensive . Bet they share the  iPhone   x  too. What's wrong with the world
undefined,"To make an "" iPhone  5  X "" would be a total loss of revenue when they can completely capitalize on the  X  screen design"

undefined,this girl told me that bringing a camera while travelling is  useless  since  iphone  can shoot better than camera now. Well
undefined,So I went to Walmart (I  hate  Walmart and this just makes it worse) besides the point I dropped my phone in the parking lot and it got RUN OVER BY A MONSTER TRUCK!!!....

undefined,Not sure where you are going. Maybe you are looking at things from a micro point of view? To deny that technology/general advancement hadn’t driven cost is simply inaccurate. Don’t know what else to say. My  iphone   X  is far more  expensive  than my original BB was. More advanced 2.
