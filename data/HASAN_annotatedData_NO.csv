no,@ Apple  @AppleSupport  I really  hate  the fact that I spent all this money on the  iPhone   X  for the camera to be so trashy! The @SamsungMobile  phoneâ€™s camera is so much better. You guys really disappointed me.
no,so in order to download a video from my  iphone  I first need to update iTunes which cannot be updated until I update the version of OS  X  that I'm running. This is why people  hate  computers
no,I  hate  when I FaceTime someone and my screen doesnâ€™t give me the hang up option. My  iPhone   X  be glitch af

no,I  hate  that  iPhone  XR
no,@ Apple  I downloaded the latest update for my  iPhone   X  and now itâ€™s a  useless  brick. The battery is supped up twice as fast or more. Iâ€™m having to charge it 3 times a day now instead of once. I thought youâ€™d given this game up?? #battery  #iPhoneX  #iphone  #apple   #batterylife
no,is my  iphone   x  the only one that sometimes has the sc image quality at like 420p why is it so  bad  sometimes

no,No cap I  hate  the  iPhone   X
no,I  hate  the Face ID on the  iPhone   X  
no,@ AppleSupport  I  hate  my  iphone   x  and my wife does too. Why does it take longer to unlock the  iphone   x  with facial recognition and having to swipe up. Than with  iphone  7 plus with thumb print recognition and no swiping up. It doesnt make sense for newer technology to be slower.
no,THEY DID IT ON A  IPHONE   x  AND THE QUALITY WAS STILL  BAD  DNDJJD

no,Iâ€™m gonna need @Apple  to do better with these damn phones. Iâ€™ve had 4 iPhones it takes for me to get the  iPhone   X  to  hate  my damn phone. Soon all the insides will be on the outside with this glass back being broken and costing $500+ to fix   #annoyed  #iphoneX
no,The one crisis I have with that is  iphone   X  only has one lightning port so if I need to also charge it with my portacharger on the go im screwed lol apple is ruining all their shit first that then the new macbooks are terrible with falling apart keyboards and a  useless  touch bar
no,I did the new battery exchange with my 6+ works fantastic again. Do not like the  iphone   X  nor the XR. Too  expensive  !

no,Just called @Apple  to find out when their trade in event ends on the  IPhone   X .  Apple customer service person didnâ€™t know when it would end or didnâ€™t even know when it started.  Stop playing games.   Bad  customer service!

no,literally the only thing I  hate  about the  iphone   x  series is the fucking screenshot mechanic

no,I  hate  the  iPhone   X  stay censoring shit off my phone like Iâ€™m a little ass kid or something.
no,Only thing I  hate  about the  iPhone   X  is that I canâ€™t fucking charge my phone and listen to music at the same time. Like bro I ainâ€™t tryna buy no $200 headphones for me just to lose one in a week
no,I use to be ON TOP of taking pics with everybody anytime I went anywhere or did anything... the camera on my  iPhone   X  has changed all that. I  hate  the camera on this thing. also

no,Reduce your pride and be humble
no,i fucking  hate   iphone   x ???? 
no,Who thought it would be a good idea to have something you swipe up from the bottom to access seeing as the  iPhone   X  and XS goes to the home screen when you do so.... welcome to the new  useless  app from @Honda  @HondaInAmerica pic.twitter.com/DLBBKAirRr
no,I was at a lunch and looked around to notice that of 10 people... only one had upgraded to the  iphone   X  and it kind of hit me... how  bad  are apples  iphone  sales right now that they basically have to go all in on a netflix clone streaming service...  $ appl
no,i  hate  the way  iphone   x  videos look
no,Same Iâ€™d  hate  to have this phone ( iPhone   x ) and get absolutely nothing should be like a bundle but without the vbucks included if you get what I mean
no,only  bad  thing about having facial ID unlock on the  iphone   X  is when you wake up in the morning looking a mess and it cant recognize your face
no,change to A5... seems decent tho.  iPhone   X  is too  expensive  ;(
no,Oh really? As far as I'm aware the  Iphone  7-8+ X -Xr-XS-XS got increasingly  expensive  as each new model released. Sure it went down eventually
no,I have  iPhone   X . I started with android HTC Droid 1 & 2 and have since been iOS for  8+ years. Contemplating a switch to Samsung s10 or s10e. 
no,Having the newest  iPhone  now ( X  and up) just made it  useless
no,Ugh I  hate  when the  iPhone   X  face recognition doesnâ€™t work because youâ€™re wearing your ray bans

no,Worst service ever experience from Hazratganj @AppleSupport  .just little dust on my  iPhone   X  and I told her to pls just clean once and rudely denied and said you need to pay.why people go with  expensive  devices as they not even giving premium service to customers @AppleSupport

no,I filed a complain about my  iPhone   X  so they can ship me out a new one (and a different color bc I  hate  the color I have rn but there was no more other colors) AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE SHIPPING THE SAME PRODUCT   ugh all the complaining for nothing
no,To create new airpods which re so simular to the old ones spending on this a few years. Apple disappointed fisrt when released the last one  iphone  XS which is so simular to the  X  one but much more  expensive  and closed  X  one trading.
no,I was surprised it has the latest processor.  Plus the apple pencil.  I like the feel of the newer apple pencil in my hand since it is squared off but you canâ€™t have everything.  I  hate  face id on my  iPhone   X .  Half the time I hold it too close and it fails.
