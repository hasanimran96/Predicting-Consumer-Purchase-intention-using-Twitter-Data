undefined,Should you  buy   iPhone   X ?
no,I don't  get  why people still  buy   iphone   x  hahaha! Such a waste of money.

undefined,@ Apple  @AppleSupport  I'm aware that you're near a ‚ÄúTrillion‚Äù dollar company. So there's no  need  to make  iPhone  7s stop working with new updates because you want people to  buy  your new product!

yes,My dad said  get  a job and he'd  buy  me the  iPhone   X  sooooo who's hiring ?!
undefined,You aren't entitled to free music! That's  like  me calling Apple and telling them I want to new  IPhone   X  and to give it to me for free! I give major props to @taylorswift13  for not putting it on streaming.  BUY  THE DAMN CD. Quit expecting free stuff.

no,The length of contract for this  IPhone   X  is 2 years as per usual ok. You pay ¬£82 per month with EE ok. Crazy eh? I would not pay that in a million years are they having a laugh or what? I would recommend you  buy  a one plus 5 for ¬£395 ok? Sim only  deal  for ¬£20 per month with 3
no,We all want 3D face login?Edge to Edge display?Or is this just the people who want an  iPhone   X ? The only reason I won't  buy  this is because of the OLED burnin.  That won't  get  much better without using other OLED displays which they haven't done yet. Too many money for me  w / that
no,Also with that money I'd rather  buy  something  like  an iPad Pro than a  iPhone    X
no,"Grayson just randomly told me ""bro for $950 you can  buy  a llama"
undefined,I  wish  the Apple keyboard was black. It looks so  nice  on the  iPhone   X  lock screen

undefined,On the  iPhone   X  I  wish  Apple adds an option of unlocking the  iphone  without that swipe up gesture. I feel that swipe up you  need  to do as of now is slowing down the unlocking process.

Undefined,iPhone   X  has been out for a little bit now and I still haven't seen a single person with one. Availability that  bad  huh?
No,Tested  $ AAPL   iPhone   X  in person. It's not  bad  but still think Samsung beat Apple at their own game with the Galaxy S8. Half year older device than  X  and still superior in terms of design/ overall feel.

Undefined,@ AppleSupport  what is the official recommendation for leaving an  iPhone   X  on a wireless charging pad (like in a desk set up) for extended periods of time? Is it  bad  for the battery to be constantly topped off
