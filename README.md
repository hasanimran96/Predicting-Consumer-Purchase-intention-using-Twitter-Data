## All material related to Final Year Project II will be uploaded here

### Project Details:
1. Scrap twitter tweets data and use twitter search API to build a dataset.
2. Annotating the data and assigning the class: PI or No PI where PI = purchase intention.
3. Initial survey of data which invloves looking at the type of tweets, checking for imbalance class, building word clouds and different graphical representations to visual the data.
4. Use different pre processing techniques on the data to build a corpus.
5. Apply different machine learing text analytical models on the dataset.
    1. Support Vector Machine
    2. Naive Bayes
    3. Logistic Regression
    4. Decision Tree
    5. Neural Network
6. Output a list of customers who have shown purchase intention towards the product.
7. Develop a website to display the summary of our work and allow users to upload their dataset and train and/or test the pre-developed models for evaluation.
